Facebook Cookie Analysis - Raw HTTP Headers
===========================================

This file contains raw HTTP headers captured during Facebook session analysis
for the post "Logging Out of Facebook Is Not Enough"

The analysis examined how Facebook cookies behave across different states:
1. Logged in request to facebook.com
2. Request to logout action
3. Immediate request to Facebook homepage
4. Request after browser restart

See /fb-table.html for formatted cookie data visualization.
