From the David Sedaris essay, [Laugh Kookaburra, Laugh](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/08/24/090824fa_fact_sedaris#ixzz16mCMhw1j):

> Pat was driving, and as we passed the turnoff for a shopping center she invited us to picture a four-burner stove.

> “Gas or electric?” Hugh asked, and she said that it didn’t matter.

> This was not a real stove but a symbolic one, used to prove a point at a management seminar she’d once attended. “One burner represents your family, one is your friends, the third is your health, and the fourth is your work.” The gist, she said, was that in order to be successful you have to cut off one of your burners. And in order to be really successful you have to cut off two.
