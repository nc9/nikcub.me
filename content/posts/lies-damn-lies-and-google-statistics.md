excerpt: Debunking the viral "Google+ traffic drops 60%" story based on flawed Chitika statistics with no published methodology - and misunderstanding launch bumps
---

One of the [big stories](http://www.techmeme.com/111010/p53#a111010p53) making the rounds in the tech world today is that traffic at Google+ has 'plummeted' a full 60% this week over last week. All of these reports cite a graph from advertising company [Chitika](http://chitika.com) (who conveniently become a 'web analytics firm' in the <a href='http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2046955/Traffic-plunges-Google-60-users-log-off.html"'>Daily Mail</a> story).

There are a few problems with these reports. First, the Chitika graph measures a 'traffic index'. There is no published methodology on how this index is measured or what it is measuring. Chitika are an advertising network, but they do not advertise on Google+. There isn't even a hint of what the 'traffic index' is or how it is measured. This has not stopped blogs and news outlets from reporting the graph as measuring pageviews.

Second, Google+ launched to the public last week. It was linked to from the homepage of Google.com – the most trafficked page on the entire world-wide web. You would expect a traffic 'bump' associated with the launch of Google+ and the associated traffic being referred to it from the Google homepage.

What these reports are based on is both an unknown black-box measurement – the Chitika 'traffic index' dropped from 119 to 45 – whatever that means, and is measuring the back-end of a launch bump. Show me a single product that has launched that has ever risen out of a traffic bump, especially one coming out of a launch on the Google home page, no less.

I [left a comment](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_plus_traffic_drops_1269_gains_erased.php#comment-331303447) on the [ReadWriteWeb post about this story](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_plus_traffic_drops_1269_gains_erased.php#comment-331305489) calling bullshit on both the graph and the story. When I asked the writer of the story in the comments what the methodology of the Chikita reporting is, his [response was](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_plus_traffic_drops_1269_gains_erased.php#comment-331310620):

> You're right. Chitika hasn't yet responded to our request for more information, and when we get it, we'll update.

A suggestion: do that _before_ a post is published citing the Chitika source as an authoritative measure of pageviews and visitors to Google+

The [blog post at Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2011/10/09/google-plus-traffic-down-60/) saw straight through this and more accurately concluded:

> what the report is actually saying is that in less than a month traffic has risen 480%, or 4.8 times.

The story with a 'traffic drops 60%' headline is being picked up absolutely everywhere – the blogs (who should know better) started out and now it is being picked up by mainstream outlets everywhere.

**Update:** The original Chikita source is from [this blog post](http://insights.chitika.com/2011/failure-to-launch-google-growth-spurt-short-lived/) on their company blog. Same crappy statistics, but they go further with unfounded conclusions on why Google+ didn't 'take off'.
