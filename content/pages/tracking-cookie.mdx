## About Tracking Cookies

Tracking cookies are small pieces of data that websites store in your browser to track your activity across different sessions and sometimes across different websites.

## How They Work

When you visit a website, it can set cookies that persist even after you close your browser or log out. These cookies can include:

- **Session cookies:** Expire when you close your browser
- **Persistent cookies:** Remain stored until they expire or you delete them
- **Third-party cookies:** Set by domains other than the one you're visiting

## Privacy Implications

Tracking cookies can be used to build profiles of your browsing behavior, which is why many privacy-focused browsers and extensions now block third-party cookies by default.
